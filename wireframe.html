                    Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Damage report! The unexpected is our normal routine. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I'll be sure to note that in my log. 
                        
                    Your shields were failing, sir. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? 
                        
                    Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Well, that's certainly good to know.
